  <section>
    <p>For my first article on this blog (or any blog for that matter), I want to present one of my favorite proofs of elementary number theory. It’s based around the concept of a <em>perfect number</em>. You know that a concept named like that ought to be interesting. A perfect number is any positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, except the fact that you don’t count the number itself in that sum. You only sum its <em>proper</em> divisors. The whole is equal to the sum of its parts; that’s why such a number is <em>perfect</em>. For instance, six is a perfect number because its proper divisors are 1, 2 and 3; if you sum these up you get back six. In fact six is the smallest perfect number. The next one is 28 as its proper divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Six is a number perfect in itself, and not because God created all things in six days; rather, the converse is true. God created all things in six days because the number is perfect.</p>
<p>– <cite>The City of God by Saint Augustine</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="the-euclid-euler-theorem">The Euclid-Euler theorem</h1>
<p>If we introduce the notation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(n)\)</span> to mean “the sum of all the positive divisors of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, including <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> itself”, then a number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is perfect if and only if <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(n)=2n\)</span>. For instance, the obvious fact that a prime number cannot be perfect can be translated as saying that for all primes <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(p)=p+1\)</span>, which is never equal to <span class="math inline">\(2p\)</span>.</p>
<p>An interesting fact about <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is that it’s a <em>multiplicative</em> function. It means that if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> are two coprime numbers (they have no prime divisors in common), then <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(nm)=\sigma(n)\sigma(m)\)</span>. Intuitively, that happens because the set of divisors of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is essentially disjoint from the set of divisors of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> — a consequence of coprimality. Therefore each divisor of <span class="math inline">\(nm\)</span> can be expressed as a product <span class="math inline">\(d_1d_2\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(d_1\)</span> divides <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d_2\)</span> divides <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Since you can express a sum of products as a product of sums, well, you get the idea.</p>
<h2 id="euclids-part">Euclid’s part</h2>
<p>In his <em>Elements</em>, three hundred years before Jesus Christ was born, Euclid proved that if <span class="math inline">\(2^p-1\)</span> is prime, then any number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> of the form <span class="math inline">\(2^{p-1}(2^p-1)\)</span> must be perfect. Using our characterization of perfect numbers using <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> and the fact that it’s a multiplicative function, that’s easy to prove:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}\sigma(n)&amp;=\sigma(2^{p-1})\sigma(2^p-1)\\&amp;=(\sum_{k=1}^{p-1}2^k)\cdot2^p\\&amp;=(2^p-1)\cdot2^p\\&amp;=2n.\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>A prime number of the form <span class="math inline">\(2^p-1\)</span> is called a <em>Mersenne prime</em>. Euclid’s result means that each Mersenne prime gives rise to a perfect number. It is not known whether or not there are infinitely many Mersenne primes, but if there were, it would prove that there are infinitely many perfect numbers.</p>
<h2 id="eulers-part">Euler’s part</h2>
<p>About two millenia after Euclid, Euler proved that any even perfect number must be of the form <span class="math inline">\(2^{p-1}(2^p-1)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(2^p-1\)</span> prime. To prove this, he used a simple proof with a very clever idea at a key moment. I still remember the first time I saw this proof. I still find it fascinating. We start with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, an even perfect number. First, we compute <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(n)\)</span> in two different but equal ways. The first way is trivial: because <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is perfect, we know that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(n)=2n\)</span>. The second way uses the fact that <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is even: we write <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(2^{k-1}m\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(k&gt;1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> odd. Now</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align}\sigma(n)&amp;=\sigma(2^{k-1})\sigma(m)\\&amp;=(2^k-1)\sigma(m).\end{align}\]</span></p>
<p>The two ways of looking at <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(n)\)</span> are equal, therefore</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2^km = (2^k-1)\sigma(m).\]</span></p>
<p>We get two things from this equation. Firstly, since <span class="math inline">\(2^k-1\)</span> is coprime to <span class="math inline">\(2^k\)</span>, we know that <span class="math inline">\(2^k-1\)</span> must divide <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. We write <span class="math inline">\(m=(2^k-1)M\)</span> for some integer <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. Secondly, we get that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(m)=2^kM\)</span> just by dividing both sides by <span class="math inline">\(2^k-1\)</span> and substituting <span class="math inline">\((2^k-1)M\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Putting these two things together, we have <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(m)=m+M\)</span>.
Here is the clever part! This means that <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> has only <em>two</em> divisors. The only integers with exactly two divisors are the primes, and so <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is a prime and <span class="math inline">\(M=1\)</span>. By substituting <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> in the above equation, we finally obtain <span class="math inline">\(m=2^k-1\)</span>. Note that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is different from <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(m = (2^k-1)M &gt; (2^1-1)M\)</span>. That’s in fact why we need <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to be even, because it guarantees that <span class="math inline">\(k&gt;1\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="putting-it-together">Putting it together</h2>
<p>By taking Euclid’s and Euler’s parts and putting them together, we get a characterization of the even perfect numbers! An even number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is perfect if and only if there exists a prime number <span class="math inline">\(2^p-1\)</span> such that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[n = 2^{p-1}(2^p-1).\]</span></p>
<p>This is called the Euclid-Euler theorem. Interestingly, it is unknown if there are any odd perfect numbers… but if there are, the smallest one must be greater than <span class="math inline">\(10^{150}\)</span>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned briefly above, that means that you can use Mersenne primes to generate perfect numbers. From GIMPS, the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search, we know for instance that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2^{77232917}-1\]</span></p>
<p>is a prime. Therefore,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2^{77232916}(2^{77232917}-1)\]</span></p>
<p>is perfect. It ends with 6.</p>
